   QUESTION
You should be able to answer the following questions to assess your project Idea:

What is the problem you are solving?
Businesses or your audience care about problems. Make the problem clear and relatable
What tools did you use?
Python? GeoPanadas? Google Big Query?
Tell your audience how you got the answer,  tools show your capability
Dive deep in this in your technical  article
What insights did you or do you want to discover?/ What Solutions do you want to offer? Do People even need these solutions?
Don’t just say “dashboard done.”
Share the “aha!” moments, they matter more that the visuals
How would a business or a community (for Social Impact Projects) benefit from your work?
Be specific. Think money saved, process improves, better decisions made
That’s your real value

     ANSWER
What problem are we solving?
We’re building a data-driven system to assess and manage insurance risk for people using demographic and geographic information (age, gender, region) and claim/charge history.
We will also segment the population into risk cohorts (low / medium / high).

TOOLS USED
Data cleaning / manipulation: Python (pandas), GeoPandas for region-level/geospatial joins.
Exploratory data analysis & visualization: matplotlib / plotly / seaborn for charts; folium or GeoPandas + matplotlib for maps; interactive dashboards with Tableau.

Insights to look at
Non-linear age risk: risk often rises steeply after a certain age bracket (e.g., 55+). A linear age term will miss that — interaction or splines reveal it.

Regional clusters: small subsets of regions can drive a disproportionate share of claims because of local factors (healthcare access, weather, road safety). Mapping the claims shows hot spots.

Gender interactions: raw averages may show little difference, but after adjusting for age and region, gender differences can flip (or disappear) — that’s important for fair pricing and regulatory compliance.

High-risk but high-value customers: some customers drive many claims but also pay higher premiums — you can design retention vs. underwriting strategies differently for them.

Seasonality & events: spikes in claims during particular months (e.g., rainy seasons -> more accidents) enable seasonal pricing or temporary prevention campaigns.

Model explainability revealing underwriting rules: SHAP can generate human-readable rules like “Age > 60 and region in X → high risk”, which underwriters can act on.
